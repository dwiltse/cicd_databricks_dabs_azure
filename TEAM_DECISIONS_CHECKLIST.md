# Team Decision Checklist: Databricks Asset Bundles & CI/CD Implementation

*Items requiring team decisions before implementation*

## üîê Authentication & Security Decisions

### 1. Databricks Authentication Strategy
**Decision Required:** How will the team authenticate to Databricks?

| Option | Dev Environment | CI/CD Pipelines | Pros | Cons |
|--------|----------------|------------------|------|------|
| **Personal Access Tokens (PAT)** | Individual PATs | Service Principal PAT | Simple setup, familiar | Security risk, manual rotation, tied to individuals |
| **OAuth M2M (Recommended)** | Individual OAuth | Service Principal OAuth | More secure, auto-rotation | Complex setup, requires Azure AD config |
| **Azure CLI (Dev Only)** | az login | Service Principal | Native Azure integration | Dev only, not suitable for CI/CD |

**Questions to Answer:**
- [ ] Do we have Azure AD admin access to create service principals?
- [ ] What is the token rotation policy (30/60/90 days)?
- [ ] Who will be responsible for credential management?
- [ ] Should developers use personal PATs or OAuth for local development?

**Recommendation:** OAuth M2M for CI/CD, individual PATs for developer workstations (easier onboarding).

### 2. Service Principal vs Personal Account Strategy  
**Decision Required:** What identity should run pipelines in different environments?

| Environment | Option A: Service Principal | Option B: Personal Accounts | Option C: Hybrid |
|-------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|------------------|
| **Development** | ‚úÖ Consistent identity | ‚ùå Resource ownership issues | üîÑ Personal for dev, SP for shared |
| **Staging** | ‚úÖ Recommended | ‚ùå Not recommended | ‚úÖ Service Principal only |
| **Production** | ‚úÖ Required best practice | ‚ùå Security risk | ‚úÖ Service Principal only |

**Questions to Answer:**
- [ ] Should each developer's personal account own their dev resources?
- [ ] How do we handle resource cleanup when developers leave?
- [ ] What permissions should the service principal have?
- [ ] Should we have separate service principals per environment?

**Recommendation:** Hybrid approach - personal accounts for individual dev schemas, service principal for staging/prod.

### 3. Unity Catalog Permissions Model
**Decision Required:** How granular should permissions be?

**Permission Levels:**
- [ ] **Metastore Level:** Who are the metastore admins?
- [ ] **Catalog Level:** Should developers have CREATE SCHEMA permissions?
- [ ] **Schema Level:** Individual ownership vs group-based?
- [ ] **Table Level:** Fine-grained permissions needed?

**Group Strategy:**
- [ ] `insurance_team_developers` - All 6 developers
- [ ] `insurance_team_admins` - Who should be catalog admins?
- [ ] `insurance_team_ci` - Service principal group
- [ ] Environment-specific groups? (`staging_users`, `prod_readonly`)

**Questions to Answer:**
- [ ] Should developers be able to create/drop their own schemas?
- [ ] Who can grant permissions to external users/teams?
- [ ] What data should be restricted (PII, financial data)?
- [ ] How do we handle external location permissions?

**Questions to Answer:**
- [ ] Do we need both individual AND shared dev environments?
- [ ] Should we have a `qa` environment separate from staging?
- [ ] What about `hotfix` environment for emergency changes?

**Questions to Answer:**
- [ ] What is the monthly compute budget?
- [ ] Should we auto-terminate idle clusters?
- [ ] Do we need different instance types for different pipelines?
- [ ] Should developers share compute resources?

## üöÄ Quick Start Decisions (Minimum Viable Setup)

If you need to start immediately with minimal decisions:

### Recommended Minimal Decisions:
1. **Authentication:** Personal PATs for dev, Service Principal for CI/CD
2. **Schema Strategy:** Individual dev schemas (safer for team learning)
3. **Branch Strategy:** Feature branches ‚Üí develop ‚Üí main
4. **Approvals:** 1 reviewer for staging, 2 reviewers for production
5. **Compute:** Serverless everywhere (simpler management)

These choices allow you to start implementation immediately while making more nuanced decisions as you gain experience with the setup.
